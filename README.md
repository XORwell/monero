# Monero Ruby Client

Ruby client to connect and use [Monero Wallet RPC](https://getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/wallet-rpc.html).

*Tested against [v0.13.0.4 Beryllium Bullet](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.13.0.4) without issues. Please contribute. If you want to send testnet transactions, please always send them back to https://dis.gratis*

---
#### Disclaimer - before you start - *important notice!*
To try out please make sure that you run your **monerod** and your **monero-wallet-rpc** with the `--stagenet` or `--testnet` option. Always use the stagenet or testnet to play around. Be careful with your wallet, you might lose coins if you try out on the real chain.

## Installation
For easy installation add `gem 'monero'` to your Gemfile or run `gem install monero`

## Preparation
Start your daemon `./monerod --testnet`

Start your RPC Client `./monero-wallet-rpc --testnet  --rpc-bind-port 28081 --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1  --rpc-login username:password --log-level 4`

- To open a wallet at start use `--wallet-file filename` and `--password pass`
- In case you need to access the client from another machine, you need to set `--confirm-external-bind`.
- To be able to create/open other wallets you need to specify `--wallet-file /path/to/wallets/on/your/machine`
- if you don't specify `--rpc-login` a file will be created that stores the login data (`cat monero-wallet-rpc.28081.login`)

You can also use
[monerod-rpc-docker](https://github.com/xaviablaza/monerod-rpc-docker) by
xaviablaza to run monerod and the RPC client.

## Getting started

### Configuration
```ruby
RPC.config.host = "127.0.0.1"
RPC.config.port = "18081"
RPC.config.username = "username"
RPC.config.password = "password"
RPC.config.transfer_clazz = "MoneroTransfer" # you can set your own class to get incoming transfers as a model rather then a json
```

### Usage

Monero Ruby Client is very easy to use. Full documentation of RPC Client: https://getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/wallet-rpc.html#transfer

---
Get the current address
```ruby
::Wallet.address
=> "9wm6oNA5nP3LnugTKRSwGJhW4vnYv8RAVdRvYyvbistbHUnojyTHyHcYpbZvbTZHDsi4rF1EK5TiYgnCN6FWM9HjTDpKXAE"
```

---
Create a new subaddress with a label
```ruby
MoneroRPC::Wallet.create_address "family savings"
=> {"address"=>"BZFWM5MrhK64DD5TH1JVxR4JbuQpmRSFKi4SHQD2TrSrDFU8AK16YSjN7K8WSfjAfnZeJeskBtkgr73LbPZc4vMbQr3YvHj", "address_index"=>1}
```

---
Create a new address for a payment (integrated address)
```ruby
MoneroRPC::Wallet.make_integrated_address
=> {"integrated_address"=>"A7TmpAyaPeZLnugTKRSwGJhW4vnYv8RAVdRvYyvbistbHUnojyTHyHcYpbZvbTZHDsi4rF1EK5TiYgnCN6FWM9HjfufSYUchQ8hH2R272H",
    "payment_id"=>"9d985c985ce58a8e"}
```

---
Get a list of all addresses of your wallet
```ruby
MoneroRPC::Wallet.get_addresses
```

---
To get the balance of the current wallet (we use the gem 'money')
```ruby
MoneroRPC::Wallet.balance
# returns an ::XMR object which is just a shortcut for ::Money(amount, :xmr)
=> <Money fractional:9980629640000 currency:XMR>

MoneroRPC::Wallet.balance.format
=> "9.980629640000 XMR"
```

To get the unlocked balance, which is currently available
```ruby
MoneroRPC::Wallet.unlocked_balance
=> <Money fractional:10000 currency:XMR>
```

To get both combined
```ruby
MoneroRPC::Wallet.getbalance
=> {"balance"=>9961213880000, "unlocked_balance"=>10000}
```

---
To get the current block height
```ruby
MoneroRPC::Wallet.getheight
=> 1008032
```

---
Send XMR to an address via `MoneroRPC::Transfer.create`. If successful you will get the transaction details. If not successful you'll get returned nil.

```ruby
amount= 20075 # in atomic units; 1000000000000 == 1.0 XMR
MoneroRPC::Transfer.create("A7TmpAyaPeZLnugTKRSwGJhW4vnYv8RAVdRvYyvbistbHUnojyTHyHcYpbZvbTZHDsi4rF1EK5TiYgnCN6FWM9HjfwGRvbCHYCZAaKSzDx", amount)
=> {"fee"=>19415760000,
    "tx_blob"=>"020001020005bbcf0896e3.......
```

The return hash consists of:
```
{amount, fee, multisig_txset, tx_blog, tx_hash, tx_key, tx_metadata,
unsigned_txset}
```

To send payments you can also specify the following options:

```ruby
options = { fee: fee, mixin: 5, unlock_time: unlock_time, payment_id: "c7e7146b3335aa54", get_tx_key: true, priority: 0, do_not_relay: false, get_tx_hex: true}
```

Please note that `fee` is currently ignored by the chain.

To send payments to multiple recipients simply use an array of `[:recipient, :amount]`. For example:

```ruby
recipients = [
  {address:"A7TmpAyaPeZLnugTKRSwGJhW4vnYv8RAVdRvYyvbistbHUnojyTHyHcYpbZvbTZHDsi4rF1EK5TiYgnCN6FWM9HjfwGRvbCHYCZAaKSzDx" amount: 1599999},
  {address:"A7TmpAyaPeZLnugTKRSwGJhW4vnYv8RAVdRvYyvbistbHUnojyTHyHcYpbZvbTZHDsi4rF1EK5TiYgnCN6FWM9Hjftr1RgJ6RM4BMMPLUc" amount: 130000},
  {address:"A7TmpAyaPeZLnugTKRSwGJhW4vnYv8RAVdRvYyvbistbHUnojyTHyHcYpbZvbTZHDsi4rF1EK5TiYgnCN6FWM9HjfrgPgAEasYGSVhUdwe" amount: 442130000}
]

MoneroRPC::Transfer.send_bulk(recipients, options)
```

---
To get a list of transfers you call `get_transfers(args)`. Options are `in (true)`, `out (false)`, `pending (true)`, `failed (false)`, `pool (true)`, `filter_by_height (false)`, `min_height` and `max_height`

---
To get all incoming transfers use `get_all_incoming_transfers(args)`. Args can be `min_height` and `max_height` to filter accordingly. Result is a list of `MoneroRPC::IncomingTransfer` objects.

```ruby
incomes = MoneroRPC::Wallet.get_all_incoming_transfers(min_height: 1087400)
=> [#<MoneroRPC::IncomingTransfer:0x000000036d3ca8 ...>, #<MoneroRPC::IncomingTransfer:0x000000036d38c0 ...>, #<MoneroRPC::IncomingTransfer:0x000000036d3258 ...>, #<MoneroRPC::IncomingTransfer:0x000000036d2c90 ...> ....

incomes.first.confirmed?
=> false

incomes.first.pending?
=> true

incomes.first.confirmations?
=> 0

incomes.first.address
=> "9vN5sHeH2a6AbRsB1dZ3APavL3YyFLguhh5pu2cAHb4CTY9GtnsEsBYTzwxzL6XH4Uby2Svju8sYvZN7mDMcd6MTKDvBgVR"

incomes.first.amount
=> 0.40123
```

You can use your own custom class by using the config `RPC.config.transfer_clazz = "MyCustomMoneroTransfer"`

---
For a specific Transfer simply call `get_transfer_by_txid(tx_id)`

---
## Running tests

Configure the RPC singleton in
[spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/krtschmr/monero/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb)

Even better would be your contribution to the code. Let's work together and make this gem a great place for all Monero fans! Don't just fork and do your own thing. My idea for this gem isn't the way we have to do. Feel free to bring yourself into this project. I'm willing to change everything from scratch if it will benefit the future.
